\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{chapter:preface}

Thank you Enrico for giving me this opportunity. Mich\'el\`e and Ute, you have 
both taught me (in your own ways) what real leadership is about. Cyril, 
thanks for showing me that patient introspection and deep thinking are still 
relevant in today's fast paced world. Bala, your guidance and wisdom elevated 
the quality of my research, you are the kind of scientist our community needs 
and I wish you the very best.

Behnaaz, we wont be able to continue our afternoon gossip sessions, but you 
should keep at it because gossip is known to lead to a long and happy life. 
Ashutosh, Casper, and Gabriel, your company meant that there was never a dull 
day at the office. Algo, always remember that the world is a non-linear, 
non-stationary, and chaotic dynamic system at the edge of criticality, so if 
you have a sample of 100 clean data points and a sample of 100 corrupted data 
points, you should add noise to the clean data set, in order to equalise the 
disaster.

Rakesh and Carl(os), I will always remember and miss our hilarious chats, very 
nice!

Nada, you make CWI a great place to work. I would not have gotten through this 
PhD so smoothly if it wasn't for you!  

Thank you Divya.

Aai and Baba, I am what I am today because of the childhood that you provided 
me. An upbringing that was full of curiosity, support, travel, wisdom, and love.
